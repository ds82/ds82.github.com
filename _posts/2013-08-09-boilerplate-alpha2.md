I recently updated my webapp [boilerplate project on github][boilerplate] to alpha2. With this update I made breaking changes to the internal structure of the projekt. As you can read on the project page, the boilerplate uses requirejs and bootstraping angular with requirejs is not straight forward. With my boilerplate, it's a piece of cake.

Here's an example controller:

{% highlight javascript linenos=table %}

{% endhighlight %}
