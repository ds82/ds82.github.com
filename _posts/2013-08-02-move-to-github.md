This blog now runs on github pages and I love it &lt;3.
I used [jekyllbootstrap] to set it up - took about a minute!

I tweaked the thing a bit here and there and changed the theme
to use [bootstrap v3][bootstrap]. Getting started with jekyll was a bit bumpy,
but I like the concept. 

Next step is to add some plugins to embedd code, github repos and stuff and of course
producing some content. Well, stay stuned.
